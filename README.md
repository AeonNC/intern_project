# 🏨 Hotel Customer Behavior Analysis

This repository contains the work done as part of my **online internship project** focused on analyzing hotel customer behavior using Python and data visualization tools. The objective was to extract insights from real-world hotel booking datasets to identify patterns in customer preferences, cancellations, and seasonal trends.

## 📌 Project Objective

The primary goals of this internship project were to:

- Understand customer booking behaviors across various hotel types.
- Analyze booking trends, cancellations, and seasonal preferences.
- Visualize patterns in customer demographics, lead time, and special requests.
- Develop actionable insights that hotel businesses can use to improve operations and customer satisfaction.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** – Data Analysis & Processing
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis environment
- **CSV Dataset** – Public hotel booking dataset (Kaggle/online source)

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset used includes information about:

- Hotel type (City vs Resort)
- Booking lead time
- Number of special requests
- Repeated guests
- Deposit type
- Customer demographics
- Reservation status (Canceled or Not)

## 📊 Key Insights

- Higher cancellation rates were seen in city hotels during weekends.
- Customers with longer lead times had a higher cancellation tendency.
- Repeated guests showed lower cancellation and higher loyalty.
- Most bookings happened via online travel agents (OTAs).

## 📈 Visualizations Included

- Booking Trends by Month
- Hotel Type Comparison (City vs Resort)
- Lead Time Distribution
- Cancellations by Deposit Type
- Special Requests Heatmap
- Repeated Guests vs First-time Visitors
